      Actively finding new ideas to open source and founding projects to simplify developers life. Application

      I love to design user interfaces focused on experience and accesibility for all kind of applications (web, mobile,
      desktop).
      And I'm very passionate about doing things right the first time, that's why I'm also very meticulous on
      architecture everything I touch.

      it (sorry to ruin the mistery).
