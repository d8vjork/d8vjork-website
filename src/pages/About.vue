          About me
        </h5>
        <p>
          I live in Murcia, Spain. I usually speak in english because I need learn (learning is my everyday),
          and yes I'm too bad with that. I consider myself a geek and otaku, I like to play some video games but
          they are not my main entertainment (but they were in my childhood), is it because I'm more technical in all this? ü§î
        </p>
        <p>
          self-taught person I'm always thinking and learning about new technologies and I love contribute in open source projects within GitHub,
          but I've some private projects in Gitlab (usually sharing some parts with the community in GitHub).
        </p>
