      <description>I live in Murcia, Spain. I usually speak in english because I need learn (learning is my everyday), and yes I&amp;rsquo;m too bad with that. I consider myself a geek and otaku, I like to play some video games but they are not my main entertainment (but they were in my childhood), is it because I&amp;rsquo;m more technical in all this? ðŸ¤” self-taught person I&amp;rsquo;m always thinking and learning about new technologies and I love contribute in open source projects within GitHub, but I&amp;rsquo;ve some private projects in Gitlab (usually sharing some parts with the community in GitHub).</description>
